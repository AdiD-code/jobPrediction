# Job Prediction

## Project Overview
The **Job Prediction and Development Model** is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed to automate the process of analyzing resumes, extracting important features, and predicting the most suitable job roles for students and fresh graduates.

This project empowers educational institutions and career counselors to offer **personalized, data-driven career advice** based on a student's background, skills, and interests.

---

## Features
- **Resume Parsing**: Extracts structured information (skills, education, experience) from raw resumes (PDF/DOCX).
- **Feature Engineering**: Prepares meaningful features for machine learning models.
- **Job Role Prediction**: Predicts ideal job sectors or roles using trained classifiers.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Multiple machine learning models are implemented and benchmarked.
- **Automation Pipeline**: From resume upload to career prediction in a seamless workflow.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SpaCy, NLTK
- **Resume Parsing**: Custom Python scripts for text extraction and NLP processing
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

## Workflow
1. **Input**: Student uploads a resume.
2. **Resume Parsing**: Extract important fields (skills, education, etc.) using NLP.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Clean and prepare data for model input.
4. **Model Prediction**: Predict the most suitable job role.
5. **Output**: Suggested career paths with probabilities.

## Model Performance
- Achieved over **85% accuracy** on validation datasets.
- Significant improvements in skill matching by feature extraction optimization.
- Demonstrated better F1-scores with XGBoost over baseline Logistic Regression models.

---

## Motivation
- Bridge the gap between academic training and industry requirements.
- Help students receive **personalized career guidance** based on skills, not just grades.
- Enhance the efficiency of career development cells in colleges.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with **real-time job market APIs** (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed).
- Building a **web-based frontend** using Flask or Streamlit.
- Incorporate **deep learning-based resume parsers** (like LayoutLM or DocFormer).
- Dynamic model updates based on new industry trends.

---

## Timeline
- **Resume Parsing Module**: Completed (Jul 2024)
- **ML Model Development and Evaluation**: Completed (Oct 2024)
